# imglib2-android-neighborhood

### Sample app based on Example4b

This app is made for knowing how to use imglib2 on android.

imglib2 has dependencies on scijava and scifio which needs javax or awt,
So I have just copied source trees under the app repo and deleted few functions.

My target of checking is "Neighborhood" methods on imglib2-algorithm and it seems working nicely.

### Requirements

Few source code on imglib2 needs java8 syntax, so this app needs to build on Android-Studio-3.0c3 or above.
